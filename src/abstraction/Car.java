//An abstract class can be defined as a class declared with the keyword “abstract” and has a restriction that it
// cannot be instantiated.

//    Is Encapsulation possible without inheritance?
//        Yes, because Encapsulation is the ability to hide a class properties from the outside world by means of
//        access methods.
//
//        Is Abstraction possible without inheritance?
//        Well, abstraction can refer to many things, but talking about OOP: No, an abstract class cannot be used
//        directly, you can only instantiate inherited classes.
//
//        Is Polymorphism possible without inheritance?
//        Yes, polymorphism is the construction of a single interface to several types of objects, for instance,
//        a single function call that can receive different classes or data types as arguments.
//        They can be inherited or not.
